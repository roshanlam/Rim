Rim is a simplified version of vim. 

How is it simplified?

The commands have been changed to make things more simple and easy to memorize.

Okay but how is it special ?

Well, you can contribute and help me make it special or you can star, watch or fork the project and wait for me to release features I am currently working on to make it special :)
